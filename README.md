Streaker
--------
Beat the Streakâ„¢ is free MLB [game](https://www.mlb.com/apps/beat-the-streak)
in which the goal is to pick a batter to get a hit in their next game,
correctly 57 times in a row. In the 18 years it has been running, no one has
beaten the streak.

This project aggregates MLB data into a MySQL database for input into machine
learning tools.

N.B. the aggregated data is work-in-progress, this is an early version.

Dependencies
------------
This project uses Retrosheet play by play
[data](https://www.retrosheet.org/game.htm).

The Chadwick
[tools](https://github.com/chadwickbureau/chadwick/releases) are used to parse
the data.

The data is aggregated in a local MySQL server database, you'll need it
listening on localhost with a ~/.my.cnf file configured with a user and
password and permission to create databases.

Installation
------------
This setup is a bit janky, maybe I'll create a makefile at somepoint.

1. Clone this repo
2. Set the `STREAKER_USER` and `STREAKER_PASS` env variables with your MySQL creds
3. Download and unzip the retrosheet pbp data you want to include into the
   project root
4. Run `install.sh`, this will create the streaker database on MySQL server
5. The streaker.streaker table contains the aggregated data, you can unload it
 into training, validation and testing csvs with `sql/unload-data.sql`:

    $ mysql < sql/unload-data.sql

6. Feed the csvs created under /tmp into your favorite ML tool!
